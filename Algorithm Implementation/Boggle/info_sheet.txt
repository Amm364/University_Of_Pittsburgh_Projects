Does your program run without error?: No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
I believe most of my program works, except for handling specific arguement cases.  If the correct arguements arent passed in, 
the program will crash. However, it does handle the -d/-b arguements.
Besides that, I dont think I had any other bugs in my program.


Additional comments to the grader:
I used an arraylist to hold the words that were guessed or added even though it said we werent allowed to use ArrayLists.
